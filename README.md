# Prediction of customer churn on bank data


## Abstract
In this project we would be predicting customer churn from bank data. We would be adopting 8 different classification models and apply stratifiedKfold cross validation to check the performance of the models. Stratified K Fold is used because it is best for classification problems. The main challenge would be the imbalanced data which would be handled using SMOTE before training the model. After cross validation of the models, three top performing models are taken and finally hyperparameter tuning is done using grid search to identify ideal hyperparameters for best performance
